        I love Minecraft! It's my favorite game!
        Minecraft is a popular sandbox video game that was originally created and developed by Markus Persson, also known as "Notch." 
        It was later acquired by Microsoft in 2014. 
        Minecraft has become one of the best-selling video games of all time, 
        with a massive player base and a vibrant modding and community-driven content ecosystem.
        How about you? What's your favorite game?
